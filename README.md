4. Install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Ideas for improvement

- make the home page responsive for mobile users.
- custom 404 page.
- do not allow more than 500-800 grams of toppings per pizza.
- calculate the order price not only on the back end but also on the client-side.
- database normalization.
